  - [CVE-2010-0011](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2010-0011)
  - [CVE-2010-2809](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2010-2809)

  Both CVEs refer to matchers that are date based releases, but the
  author of the library switched to normal version numbering after
  that, so these CVEs are reported as relevant even though they are
  not.

  regular versions
